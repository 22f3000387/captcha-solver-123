# CAPTCHA Solver Demo Application This is a simple, single-page web application demonstrating a client-side CAPTCHA solver interface. It's built using plain HTML, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS to be fully responsive. ## Features - **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS. - **Dynamic Image Loading**: Loads CAPTCHA images from a URL query parameter (`?url=https://.../image.png`). - **Default Image**: If no URL parameter is provided, it defaults to the `sample.png` image. - **Client-Side Verification**: Includes a basic JavaScript function to verify user input against a hardcoded correct CAPTCHA text. ## Usage 1. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.** You can simply double-click the file. 2. **To load a specific CAPTCHA image from a URL:** Append a `?url=` query parameter to the `index.html` path in your browser's address bar. For example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/your-captcha.png` (Note: Due to browser security policies, directly loading images from external HTTP/HTTPS URLs might be restricted when opening `file://` URLs. For external images, it's best served from a web server.) 3. **Default Image**: If no `url` parameter is provided, the application will display `sample.png`. 4. **Solve the CAPTCHA**: Look at the image and type the text you see into the input field. 5. **Verify**: Click the 'Verify CAPTCHA' button or press `Enter`. The result will be displayed below the button. For the `sample.png` image, the correct answer is `ADUR3`. ## Technologies Used - **HTML**: For the basic structure of the web page. - **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design. - **JavaScript**: For dynamic behavior, image loading, and CAPTCHA verification logic. ## Local Development To run this application, you only need a web browser. No special setup or server is required, as it's a purely client-side application. ## License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
